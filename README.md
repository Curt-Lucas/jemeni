# J.E.M.E.N.I

Joint Electronic Message Encryption and Normalization Interface

A new breed of cryptography. J.E.M.E.N.I enables the peer-to-peer (P2P) sending and receiving of sensitive information through cryptographic-normalization.

## Purpose

Using an algorithm and key, transform an input (i.e., plaintext) into an encrypted output (i.e., ciphertext, experimental)

## Goals

Create unique outside-of-the-box cryptography solutions that are accessible to everyone.
